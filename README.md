# DKPro-Morphological-Analyzer-Wrappers

### Overview ###
- This project contains three DKPro Core morphological analyzers wrapped as web services in the LAPPSGrid. More specifically, these are the Mate Tools Morphological Analyzer (MateMorphTagger), the RF Tagger Morphological Analyzer (RFTagger), and the SFST Morphological Analyzer (SFSTAnnotator). Each web service captures the lemma and part-of-speech tag of each word of a sentence as defined by the morphological analyzer.
